        "1. Briefly discuss the effect of solver on your dataset:\n",
        "The solver in logistic regression decides how the model finds the best coefficients for predicting the target. On the Iris dataset, which is small, most solvers like lbfgs, newton-cg, and saga gave very high accuracy, but liblinear was a bit lower because it uses a one-vs-rest method for multi-class problems, which is not as stable for very small datasets. On the Heart Disease dataset, which is a medium-sized binary dataset, all solvers gave almost the same accuracy. This shows that for small to medium datasets, solver choice does not change accuracy much, but it can affect how fast the model learns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Have you found the similarity as mentioned by Sklearn that which solver is best for small, medium or larger dataset:\n",
        "Yes, the results are similar to what Sklearn recommends. For small datasets like Iris, solvers such as lbfgs, newton-cg, and newton-cholesky work well because they are stable and handle multi-class problems. Solvers like sag and saga are designed for larger datasets and use stochastic methods to converge faster. Our Heart Disease dataset is a medium-sized dataset, and all solvers gave similar results, which matches Sklearn’s explanation that solver mainly affects speed for bigger datasets but not accuracy for small or medium datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Which solver is best in your case and why:\n",
        "For the Iris dataset, lbfgs or newton-cg is the best because they gave the highest accuracy and are stable for multi-class problems on small datasets. For the Heart Disease dataset, which is slightly larger, lbfgs or saga works well because they converge reliably and handle binary classification without issues. In general, the best solver depends on the size and type of dataset, but for these datasets, lbfgs is a safe and reliable choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Now copy this file and apply a new dataset (Heart Disease) and compare, does it really get affected by the size of dataset:\n",
        "When we applied the same solvers to the Heart Disease dataset, which is bigger than Iris, we saw that accuracy stayed almost the same for all solvers. This shows that for small to medium datasets, the solver does not really affect accuracy much. What changes more is how fast the model reaches the final solution. For very large datasets, solvers like sag and saga would be better because they can learn faster without using too much memory. So yes, the dataset size can affect which solver is faster, but for these datasets, accuracy was not affected by the size."

        "Perceptron and Logistic Regression are both used for classification, but they work differently. A Perceptron is a simple model that makes yes or no predictions by calculating a weighted sum of the inputs and applying a step function, so it cannot give probabilities and only works well if the classes are linearly separable. Logistic Regression also uses a weighted sum of inputs but passes it through a sigmoid function to output a probability between 0 and 1, which allows it to handle overlapping classes better. Logistic Regression uses gradient-based methods to find the best weights and can include regularization to prevent overfitting, making it more robust than the Perceptron.\n"
